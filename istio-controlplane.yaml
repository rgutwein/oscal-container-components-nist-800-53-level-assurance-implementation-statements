        Istio leverages authservice which allows the use of an extenrral idtntiy OIDC provider for application login
          by configuring filter chain matching for hostname (headers) for applications.  This control can then
          be inherited by the Identity Provider (i.e, adfs, oidc)

        Istio leverages Keycloak for application account management functionality - temporary user accounts are prohibited as all accounts with access to Istio
        are defined as privileged users. In the event a temporary user account needs to be created for an independent audit for example, the identity provider (adfs or oidc) 
        has baked in policies to automatically remove temporary accounts within 72 hours.
